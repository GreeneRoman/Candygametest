Design Thinking: I thought about such a game, because from my opinion kids like candies, and would continuously be engaged when see such a content on screen.
The colors like green, pink, blue are more liked by kids, as myself as a kid I was attracted towards these colors.

Another thing, I choose different candies , so that at every moment there is a new experience for kids.

Fonts are also well kept in mind that suits well to kids.
